Coding Exercises for learning
------------------------------
1. Combo/Array Addition comparison
	* Coderbyte exercise
	* Need to revist and submit
	<pre>
		Using the JavaScript language, have the function ArrayAdditionI(arr) take the array of numbers stored in arr and return the string true if any combination of numbers in the array can be added up to equal the largest number in the array, otherwise return the string false. For example: if arr contains [4, 6, 23, 10, 1, 3] the output should return true because 4 + 6 + 10 + 3 = 23. The array will not be empty, will not contain all the same elements, and may contain negative numbers.

1. Letter Count
	* Coderbyte exercise
	* Uses IIFE Module Pattern
	* Jasmine Tests included
	<pre>
		Have the function LetterCountI(str) take the str parameter being passed and return the first word with the greatest number of repeated letters. For example: "Today, is the greatest day ever!" should return greatest because it has 2 e's (and 2 t's) and it comes before ever which also has 2 e's. If there are no words with repeating letters return -1. Words will be separated by spaces.

1. Sum Square Difference
	* Project Euler #6 - sum square difference
	* Using Object Module Pattern for functions
	<pre>
		The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
		12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
		The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
		(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
		Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
		Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
