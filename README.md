1. Combo
	* Coderbyte exercise
	* Takes an array and a number and sees 

1. Letter Count
	* Coderbyte exercise
	* Uses IIFE Module Pattern
	* Jasmine Tests included

1. Sum Square Difference
	* Project Euler #6 - sum square difference
	* Using Object Module Pattern for functions
	
	```
	The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
	12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
	The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
	(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
	Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
	Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
