Coding Exercises
----------------
1. Combo/Array Addition comparison
	* Coderbyte exercise
	* Need to revist and submit

	> Using the JavaScript language, have the function ArrayAdditionI(arr) take 
	> the array of numbers stored in arr and return the string true if any 
	> combination of numbers in the array can be added up to equal the largest 
	> number in the array, otherwise return the string false. For example: if 
	> arr contains [4, 6, 23, 10, 1, 3] the output should return true because 
	> 4 + 6 + 10 + 3 = 23. The array will not be empty, will not contain all the 
	> same elements, and may contain negative numbers.

1. Letter Count
	* Coderbyte exercise
	* Uses IIFE Module Pattern
	* Jasmine Tests included

	> Have the function LetterCountI(str) take the str parameter being passed and 
	> return the first word with the greatest number of repeated letters. 
	> For example: "Today, is the greatest day ever!" should return greatest because 
	> it has 2 e's (and 2 t's) and it comes before ever which also has 2 e's. 
	> If there are no words with repeating letters return -1. Words will be separated by spaces.

1. Sum Square Difference
	* Project Euler #6 - sum square difference
	* Using Object Module Pattern for functions

	> The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
	> 12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
	> The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
	> (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
	> Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural 
	> numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
	> Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred 
	> natural numbers and the square of the sum.

1. Even Divider
	* Project Euler #5 - smallest multiple
	* Straight functions - uses two functions

	>2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
	>What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

1. Mean Mode
	* Coderbyte challenge
	* Used Revealing module pattern IIFE

	>Using the JavaScript language, have the function MeanMode(arr) take the array of numbers stored in arr and	   >return 1 if the mode equals the mean, 0 if they don't equal each other (ie. [5, 3, 3, 3, 1] should return 	      >1 because the mode (3) equals the mean (3)). The array will not be empty, will only contain positive 
        >integers, and will not contain more than one mode.
